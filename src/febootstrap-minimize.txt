NAME
    febootstrap-minimize - Minimize an febootstrap image

SYNOPSIS
     febootstrap-minimize [--options] DIR

DESCRIPTION
    *febootstrap-minimize* minimizes an febootstrap(8)-created filesystem.
    This means that unneeded files and cruft are removed from the image.

    If no options are given, the default is to minimize the image as much as
    possible. This means, for example, that locales are removed so the image
    will only be usable in US-English, there will be no documentation or
    manual pages, and the image will only work in a UTC timezone.

    Note that image minimization involves deleting files that have been
    installed by RPM. Thus after minimization, it is no longer guaranteed
    that RPM will function correctly on the image. You should only do this
    as a final step for "throwaway" appliances that do not need to be
    modified or upgraded in future.

OPTIONS
    --all
        Perform all minimization operations, to produce the smallest
        possible image. Note in particular that locales are discarded.

        You can perform all minimization operations *except* X, Y and Z by
        doing:

         febootstrap-minimize --all --keep-X --keep-Y --keep-Z ...

        ("--all" can be omitted since it is the default).

    --none
        Start with no minimization operations. You can specify *only*
        minimization operations X, Y and Z like this:

         febootstrap-minimize --none --drop-X --drop-Y --drop-Z ...

    --keep-locales
    --drop-locales
        Keep or drop locale support.

    --keep-docs
    --drop-docs
        Keep or drop documentation, man pages and info files.

    --keep-cracklib
    --drop-cracklib
        Keep or drop cracklib libraries.

    --keep-i18n
    --drop-i18n
        Keep or drop "/usr/share/i18n".

    --keep-zoneinfo
    --drop-zoneinfo
        Keep or drop all timezones (except UTC which is never deleted).

    --keep-rpmdb
    --drop-rpmdb
        Keep or drop the RPM and YUM package databases. Obviously RPM and
        YUM will be completely non-functional if you drop these.

    --keep-yum-cache
    --drop-yum-cache
        Keep or drop the yum cache. Note that febootstrap(8) has already
        deleted this directory unless you ran it with the "--no-clean"
        option.

    --keep-services
    --drop-services
        Keep or drop the "/etc/services" file. If dropped, this file is
        replaced with a very minimal one which just lists the most common
        services. For less common services you will have to refer to them by
        port number instead of name.

    --keep-sln
    --drop-sln
        Keep or drop "/sbin/sln" (statically linked "ln"). This is not
        really required in minimal appliances.

    --keep-ldconfig
    --drop-ldconfig
        Keep or drop "/sbin/ldconfig", "/etc/ld.so.cache" and
        "/var/cache/ldconfig" (the dynamic linking cache). This is not
        needed. Dynamic linking during program execution will be marginally
        slower.

    --pack-executables
        This option has been removed in febootstrap 2.5. In previous
        versions it was used to pack executables using the external "upx"
        program. However it was not enabled by default and never worked very
        effectively.

TODO
    *   Deduplicate files with the same content (by hardlinking them). See
        the program hardlink(1).

    *   Remove unused binaries.

    *   Remove unused libraries.
