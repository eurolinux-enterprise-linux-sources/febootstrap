NAME
    febootstrap-install - Install a file in an febootstrap root filesystem

SYNOPSIS
     febootstrap-install ROOT LOCALFILE TARGETPATH MODE OWNER[.GROUP]

DESCRIPTION
    This can be used to safely install a new file in an febootstrap root
    filesystem.

    Just copying a file in isn't usually safe, for reasons which are to do
    with the fakeroot(8) command.

EXAMPLE
     febootstrap-install initramfs new-fstab /etc/fstab ugo=rw root.root

SEE ALSO
    febootstrap(8), febootstrap-run(8), fakeroot(1), fakechroot(1).
