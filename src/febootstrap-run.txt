NAME
    febootstrap-run - Run extra commands in febootstrap root filesystem

SYNOPSIS
     febootstrap-run [--options] DIR [--] [CMD ...]

DESCRIPTION
    This can be used to run extra commands in the febootstrap root
    filesystem. It is just a simple wrapper around the standard "fakeroot"
    and "fakechroot" commands.

    If given, the "CMD ..." is run inside the root filesystem. The command
    acts as if it was run as root and chrooted into the root filesystem.

    If the command is omitted, then we start a shell.

    If "CMD ..." could contain anything starting with a "-" character then
    use "--" to separate "febootstrap-run" parameters from the command:

     febootstrap-run ./f10 -- ls -l

OPTIONS
    --ro
        Usually any changes to permissions made by the command are recorded
        in the "fakeroot.log" file. However if "--ro" flag is given, then
        changes to permissions are not recorded. (Note: changes to file
        contents still happen).

EXAMPLES
    Remove a directory subtree safely:

     febootstrap-run initramfs -- rm -r /etc

    (This requires that you have a compatible 'rm' command in the root).

    Another way to do complex operations from a script is to export a
    function:

     #!/bin/bash

     do_stuff ()
     {
         # complex operations inside the root
     }
     export -f do_stuff
     febootstrap-run root -- bash -c do_stuff

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
    Some fakechroot(1) environment variables are applicable. In particular
    you may want to set:

     export FAKECHROOT_EXCLUDE_PATH=/proc
