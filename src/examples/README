You should read and edit these scripts before running them!

You don't need to be root, in fact, you *shouldn't* be root
when running these scripts!

If you want to run the scripts without installing febootstrap,
then you need to make your $PATH point to the top build
directory, eg:

  PATH=$(pwd)/..:$PATH
